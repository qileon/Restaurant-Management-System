Report for the Code:

1. Introduction
This report documents a basic Restaurant Management System (RMS) implemented using Python and the Tkinter library. The system allows users to manage menus with categories, create and modify customer orders, and display order details.

2. Requirements and Specifications
Functional Requirements:
The system must allow adding menu items with names, prices, and categories (Food or Drinks).
Users can create new orders and add items from the menu to those orders.
The system should display the order details, including item names, prices, and the total order amount.
Users can remove items from the current order.
The system should allow placing an order, finalizing the current order, and creating a new one.

Non-Functional Requirements:
The system should have a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI).
The interface should be easy to understand and navigate.
Basic error handling should be implemented to prevent invalid inputs.

3. Testing
The following tests were conducted to ensure the functionality of the RMS:
Menu Items:
Verified that menu items can be added with different names, prices, and categories.
Adding Orders:
Tested adding items from both food and drinks categories to a new order.
Order Display:
Confirmed that the order details, including item names, prices, and the total amount, are displayed accurately.
Removing Items:
Tested removing items from the current order and verified the update in the order display.
Placing Orders:
Verified that placing an order creates a new empty order while preserving the previous order details.
Error Handling:
Tested entering invalid item numbers for adding or removing from the order. Ensured appropriate error messages are displayed.

4. Results
All tests passed successfully. The RMS functions as designed, allowing users to manage menus, create and modify orders, and display order details with a user-friendly interface.

5. Conclusion
This report demonstrates a functional Restaurant Management System implemented using Python and Tkinter. The system fulfills the specified requirements and provides a basic framework for managing restaurant menus and orders. Further development could include features like managing tables, user accounts with different permissions, order history, and printing receipts.
